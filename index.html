We did this by adding a flex wrap which makes the flipbox go to the next line once all the space is used up. We made the flipboxes go horizontaly across the page by changing the style. We got this code from W3 schools. This will apply to my project because I will need to add the icon of the two goals I am doing to my page and I will need to change the position of them.</td>

This will be important when coding my website. This is because I will want an icon or logo to take up a certain amount of space at all times and this stage will help me do that. For example with my flipboxes, I will want them to take up a certain amount of space and when the page is resized then I would want the flipbox to still take up the same amount of space as before.</td>

        In stage 4b we learned how to display data compared to one another. We did this by dividing the data by the largest data set. This is an example of how we did this: val1s = val1/largest*iw . This will be important in my website because when I want to show data in the form of a graph I will be able to by dividing the data by the largest data set.</td>
